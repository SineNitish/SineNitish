I'm Sine Nitish, and I'm from Vizag. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor of Technology in the Computer Science and Engineering stream at Madanapalle Institute of Technology
and Science,India
I attended a CBSE board Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 2, SVN school, till my X grade, later I transferred to a state board, Sri Chaitanya junior college. 
My father is a retired army officer, and my mother is a homemaker. I'm having an elder brother who is a software engineer
 
My interests include learning about new technologies and improving programming skills. I've also completed online platformer courses in AI/ML, Cybersecurity,
and programming skills, which I've deposited in my Linkedin account.
My short-term ambition is to work as a software developer for large multinational corporations such as Google and Microsoft, 
and my long-term goal is to launch a software startup. ELON MUSK, the guy who dared to invent the future, is a massive inspiration to me.

Achievements and defeats are inextricably related to successes and setbacks. Anyone who accomplishes something today has missed something the day before.
My family has always been a source of inspiration and motivation for me, especially my mother. That is why I am today a self-motivated, empowered, and committed person.
All this success, hard work, dedication, and determination are truly credited to my parents who had made this possible for me.
